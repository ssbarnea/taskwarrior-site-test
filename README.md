# taskwarrior-site-test

A table filter experimentation for TaskWarrior web site.  
The goal is to improve the http://taskwarrior.org/tools/ list.
See: http://brunovernay.github.io/taskwarrior-site-test/

Depending on the branch: 

* GitHub rely on the branch name `gh-pages` to publish the site!
* in branch `filterjs` I motsly used this example: http://jiren.github.io/filter.js/, but it does not seem very popular/supported/known.
* in branch `ang2` I look at Angular2, but it is too big and invasive for this use case.
* http://KnockOutJS.com/ looks good
